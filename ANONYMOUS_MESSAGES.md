# Anonymous Messages WordPress Plugin Implementation

A WordPress plugin that allows site visitors to send anonymous messages through a Gutenberg block with spam protection, session-based rate limiting, and admin management features.

**Latest Progress:** ðŸ”§ ADMIN-ONLY CATEGORY SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED! Modified category system so visitors can no longer choose categories when submitting questions - only admins can assign and update categories after message submission. This improves content organization and prevents category misuse. Visitors can still filter answered questions by category. The admin interface now includes dropdown selectors for each message to assign/change categories with real-time AJAX updates!

## Implementation Plan

### Architecture Overview

The plugin will consist of several key components:

1. **Plugin Core**: Main plugin file, activation/deactivation hooks, and settings
2. **Gutenberg Block**: Custom block for frontend message submission
3. **Database Layer**: Custom tables for messages, categories, and responses
4. **Admin Interface**: WordPress admin pages for management
5. **AJAX Handlers**: Server-side processing for frontend requests
6. **Security Layer**: reCAPTCHA integration and rate limiting

### Data Flow

1. **Message Submission**:
   - User fills message form in Gutenberg block (no category selection)
   - Block admin selects assigned user (if configured)
   - reCAPTCHA v3 verification
   - Session check for rate limiting
   - Message stored in database with random sender name and user assignment (no category)
   - Success/error response to frontend

2. **Message Display**:
   - AJAX request for answered questions with user filtering
   - Instant search with debounced queries (300ms)
   - Category and search filtering applied simultaneously
   - Questions displayed with responses
   - Pagination for large datasets

3. **Admin Management**:
   - Admin views messages filtered by user assignment (role-based access)
   - **Admin assigns categories** - Categories can only be assigned by admin after message submission
   - **Category editing** - Admin can change and update message categories as needed
   - Configurable post type for responses (existing/custom/disabled)
   - Responds with post or short answer based on configuration
   - Manages categories and featured questions
   - Updates message status with user-specific permissions

### Technical Components

- **WordPress Hooks**: Proper integration with WordPress lifecycle
- **Dynamic Post Types**: Configurable post types (existing/custom/disabled) with automatic registration
- **Enhanced Database Schema**: User assignment support with automatic migration system
- **Session Management**: PHP sessions for rate limiting
- **Advanced AJAX Endpoints**: User-aware API with instant search and filtering
- **reCAPTCHA v3**: Google's invisible captcha system
- **Enhanced Gutenberg Block**: User selection and advanced configuration options
- **Real-time Search**: Debounced instant search with combined filtering
- **Role-based Access Control**: User-specific message management and permissions

### Environment Configuration

- **WordPress 5.0+**: Required for Gutenberg support
- **PHP 7.4+**: For modern PHP features
- **MySQL 5.7+**: For database functionality
- **Google reCAPTCHA v3**: API keys required
- **Session Support**: PHP sessions enabled
